# DotaCraft
Recreating Warcraft III inside Dota 2

We are now entering a closed Alpha stage, gathering a team of dedicated testers to fill the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/MNoya/DotaCraft/issues) and continue polishing the game. If you are interested in playtesting all sort of abilities, mechanics and interactions, finding bugs or missing content, [sign up on the wiki page here](https://github.com/MNoya/DotaCraft/wiki/Alpha-Testing-Team).

See the spreadsheet tracking our progress [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qwyG20YNi88G-SFYbaiyxi11Vtar8kjNXXJCMZyF7Y0/edit#gid=1929065693)
